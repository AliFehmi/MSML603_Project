There is no script to run my code, one thing to keep in my mind is I am transforming data to tensors so that I can use it in CNN. However I did not include to code that takes it back so if you run CNN you are not able to run the feedforward NN again, unless you read the data and transform it. There is optional part in the last code cell where I myself implemented the CNN with 40+ hours of effort.
